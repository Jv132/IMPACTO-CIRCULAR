# ♻️ About

Our platform aims to connect companies that want to implement a waste management plan with recycling cooperatives, in order to increase revenue and thus improve the working conditions of waste collectors.

The inspiration for the project idea was the movie “**A Melhor Mãe do Mundo (2025)”**, where a desperate mother flees with her kids, hiding them in her recycling cart, and she transforms their harsh reality into a thrilling journey, shielding them from the truth of their precarious situation.
